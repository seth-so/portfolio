Hi my name is Seth So! I'm a young adult doing my best to get by in this crazy world. This is the place where I like to document different things I've done - mostly its projects or interesting work, but I'm looking to expand and share some of my hobbies as well - skiing, handwriting, and messing about with friends. At some point I'm looking to get a boater's license and amateur pilot license so some of the fallout will probably leak here as well.

I really love meeting new people and trying new things - it keeps life interesting, and my guiding philosophy is to deliberately learn to enjoy as many things as possible. 

One way or another (maybe I'm on the job hunt?), you've managed to stumble across this page. Have fun taking a look at my little museum and don't ever hesitate to reach out. Thanks for stopping by! Here's a quick video of me falling down (in blue) and a video of me trying to somersault up a hill (in light gray)

P.S. You can blame my friends for filming in portrait.
