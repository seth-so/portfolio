## A little about me
Hi my name is Seth So! I'm a young adult doing my best to get by in this crazy world. This is the place where I like to document different things I've done - mostly its projects or interesting work, but I'm looking to expand and share some of my hobbies as well. These include skiing, handwriting, and basic sketching. At some point I'm looking to get a boater's license and amateur pilot license so some of the fallout will probably leak here as well.

I have 2 guiding philosophes: 1. Deliberately learn to enjoy as many things as possible - foods, classes, people, you name it. Recently I've gotten into interactive art - currently I'm making a theremin with a friend as well as a fake mirror art installation, 2. Giving back to community - building others up is a great way to build yourself up. I'm volunteering with a school for handicapped children to help make quality of life improvements for the students and faculty, and I'd be lying if I said my time spent benefitted me any less than it did them.

One way or another (maybe I'm on the job hunt?), you've managed to stumble across this page. Have fun taking a look at my little museum and don't ever hesitate to reach out. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm the one in blue:
