## Introduction
Research has been a pretty integral part of my work and design experience. I've been able to train on industry equipment at smaller scales, design a system from scratch and build it up for evaluation, and tackle my specific role in collaboration with others. Also interestingly, it's really taught me the importance of storytelling - every step of the research process requires it. Proposals to secure funding, stump speeches to get collaborators, attending conferences, and lastly publishing. Then the process starts all over again.

I got involved in research pretty early on - a stint assisting with animal surgeries in an immunology lab, and a taste of independent additive manufacturing research. After declaring for ECE, I began my current research: making and testing biosensors, TEP devices, and OLEDs.

Note: This section will only include brief project context and parts that I was directly involved with in NEDL. there's a lot more going on not shown that I'd be more than happy to answer any questions about [here](https://seth-so.github.io/portfolio/contact/){:target="_blank"}. All figures were made by me.


# Nano-Biosensors
Designing, fabricating, and characterizing biosensors is my primary project. For better or for worse, the comparison I've found that helps people understand the best what I do is with [Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos){:target="_blank"}. The conceptual goal is to create a device that uses trace amounts of blood for rapid disease diagnosis - the major difference is that mine has evidence of working (and that I unfortunately did not receive millions in funding). Here is a holistic physical description:

The device consists of 3 parts: a flexible PET substrate, gold electrodes, and a polyaniline sensing channel. Polyaniline, a p-type organic semiconductor, is functionalized with a series of crosslinkers to attach anti-BNP receptors. The target molecule is BNP (The target molecule is b-type natriuretic peptide), which is a protein released by the heart when its ventricles undergo strain - as such it is a well established biomarker for early indication of cardiovascular disease.

### Theory
At its core, the device is an ion selective field effect transistor, or ISFET. Using the standard transistor analogy, the ISFET acts like a valve controlling the flow of current, except its operated with target molecule concentration instead of direct gate voltage. They're usually used as pH sensors given the ease of measuring H+ concentration, but this idea can be extended to any charged molecule including different biomarker proteins with the inclusion of an organic channel path to accommodate functionalization of antibodies.

![ISFET mechanism](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/biosensor/theory-mechanism.PNG){: .center-image }

Above is a simplified visualization of what is happening. A blood sample is placed over the device, and an amount of target molecules proportional to their concentration conform to the antibodies and induce a polarization in the semiconducting layer. This increase in mobility can be observed by measuring the current flow in response to an applied electrode voltage. Using this result, current response can be mapped directly to biomarker concentration.


### Realization & Testing
The biosensors are fabricated with a bottom-up process in an ISO4 (class 10) cleanroom at the [NFCF](http://www.nano.pitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}. To begin, PET is cut in the shape of standard 4" wafer. Lithography involves standard spin-coating and maskless exposure. The first layer is a mixture of gold-chromium electrodes optimized for flexibility deposited via electron beam deposition. The second layer is the polyaniline bridge which is chemically synthesized in an ice bath to precisely control thickness. Antibodies are deposited directly on and left to adhere for 6 hours before a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is deposited to increase specificity 30 minutes before testing.
All solutions were diluted in phosphate buffer solution to optimize for Debye-screening length.

Pictured above is a wafer containing 150 sensors. For testing, a 2uL droplet of UPMC patient plasma is deposited directly onto the polyaniline channel. A potentiostat generates a linear voltage sweep across the electrodes. The gate is biased with -0.4V by an external power source. The recorded current and reference charge response is then analyzed. Below is an example output from samples across 80 patients:

Current Response          |  Reference Charge Response
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![current](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/biosensor/test-matlabcurrent.PNG) |  ![charge](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/biosensor/test-matlabcharge.PNG)


### Results & Analysis
Initial testing was conducted with artificially spiked samples, and after success subsequent samples were collected from UPMC patients through the UPMC Cardiovascular Institute. All results here are in association with the latter phase.

Baseline Testing          |  Blind Sample Testing
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![control](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/biosensor/test4-healthy.PNG) |  ![blind](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/biosensor/test5-color.PNG)

 First a batch of healthy subject samples were tested as a control to establish a baseline. Then, a mix of healthy and at-risk patient samples were blindly tested. the results on the right show linear separation between samples depending directly on sample BNP concentration, with relatively little spread outside data classes.

Flexibility Query          |  Hemolysis Query

Additional device testing was also conducted to evaluate the potential of the sensors as a wearable. As a thin film device capable of structural flexibility, the effect of different bending radii were shown to have insignificant effect on signal fidelity, with strong restoration ability. The size of the sensors ensure that no smaller radii were needed. On the right is a brief characterization to observe the effects of hemoglobin concentration of sample conductivity. The figure shows a difference heat-map, where the darkest red displays a difference of 0.4pA from the green, indicating that iron in blood is strongly solvated and inconsequential to measurements

Principle Component Analysis          |  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

An additional 84 patient sample responses were analysed with PCA and QDA. Results demonstrated high success with binary classification of data. Accuracy should be well above 95% when multiple redundant samples are taken (given 2uL per sample). Additionally, this result could easily be used to develop a visual classifier based on output signal strength.

# Micro-TEP Devices
This is a secondary project that I assist a colleague with. TEP stands for thermo-electric power, or simply converting heat gradients directly into electrical energy. Naturally, the aim is to create devices to place in areas with steep temperature changes to generate power. The project is currently in the optimization and formula tweaking phase.


### Theory
Temperature is the kinetic motion of particles, including electrons. Due to this motion being entropic, heat flows down concentration gradients to reach equilibrium. In an environment with excess free electrons, the particles are electrons and follow the same behaviour. Given a path with sufficient conductivity and carrier mobility, electron movement is sizable and easily detectible as current.

This coupling of electrostatics and the second law of thermodynamics is described by the  [Seebeck Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect){:target="_blank"}, which links electric potential and temperature gradient. The environment used for electron flow in NEDL TEP devices is 2D graphene embedded with silica nanoparticles.

![TEP device](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/tep/theory-device.PNG){: .center-image }

The practical application of such a device is micro-energy harvesting. System inefficiencies usually manifest in the form of heat loss, and this provides an opportunity to recapture lost energy and cycle it back into the system.


### Realization & Testing
Like the biosensors, devices were fabricated in the clean room. After finishing, graphene was grown via laboratory CVD and wet transferred onto the devices. The devices were seeded with gold or silver nanoparticles and then observed with a scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope to confirm proper particle growth.

The final device is structure with 12 pads with varying connectivity that each have absorbers that flow through a graphene sheet. Below shows one device under approximately 7x and 14x respectively. Tests were conducted with a Signatone probe station paired with an Agilent semiconductor analyzer at low temperature.

### Results & Analysis
The devices were tested and characterized for standard IV curves to determine turn on voltage and resistivity, but I do not have any graphs presently. Here instead is another characterization test used to observe temperature effect on sheet mobility and concentration.

These tests were carried out for various samples with combinations for single and multilayer graphene, presence of red nanoparticles, and substrate type to find the most temperature dependent conductivities. This is needed in order to drive down turn on voltage and make the devices as efficient as possible for viability.

# Organic LEDs
Fabrication of OLEDs has been an ongoing side query in collaboration with SAINT Lab from Sungkyunkwan University of South Korea. Given the flexible biosensors, the goal is to integrate high-efficiency OLEDs into the biosensor to create a full flexible, wearable sensing and indication system


### Theory
Simplified, OLEDs are composed of 2 electrodes to generate a potential, several inner layers that have precisely matched energy band-gap interactions to optimize for energy dissipation in an emissive layer, usually quantum dot.

![layers](https://github.com/seth-so/portfolio/raw/master/assets/img/research/oled/theory-layers.PNG){: .center-image }

Devices were created with both red and green emissive layers to characterize differences between different size quantum dot in OLEDs.


### Realization & Testing
OLED fabrication was a simple layering process. Successive layers (above) were precisely spin-coated on top of a indium tin-oxide (ITO) glass slide and soft-baked. A final 80nm aluminum electrode layer was deposited via electron beam deposition.

The design process was iterative, beginning with the array on the left and culminating with the design on the right, which involved more complex fabrication and structure. Testing was conducted with an Agilent semiconductor analyzer probe station.


### Results & Analysis
Below are characterization tests about stability of the present OLED design.

Stability tests were run over the course of 7 weeks to observe degradation and oxidation of layers. Groups 1 and 2 correspond to two batches, each containing a mix of red and green emissive layers. Left shows the standard current-voltage characteristics. Results show a slow shift to higher turn on voltages, albeit inconsistent. Right shows a breakdown of individual OLED changes from week to week, showing no uniform trend of degradation.


## Writing
To reiterate, each project above has a lot more going on around, I just included that parts that I was directly involved in and knew the best. Some extra things I work on is making a vacuum chamber for ultra low-noise testing and making CAD concept figures for proposals, and the proposals themselves.
