## Introduction
I really enjoy writing - in an alternate timeline, I'm sure that I'm living the life as an essayist right now. Unfortunately I haven't quite gotten as many opportunities to write as an engineer. Recently I've begun writing google reviews to scratch a creative writing itch. The most important aspect to me is the tone of a piece. For this blog/folio its fairly jaunty, but for technical reports I try to keep it clear and concisely thorough.

On a technical end, I'm extremely comfortable with Microsoft Office and prefer to make all of my presentations as .pptx's. I prefer to write documents in LaTeX now, but sometimes for reviewing its easier to use Word's built in comment system. For website writing, I'm using Markdown on Atom.

Here I scrounged together some random files I had from undergrad. I didn't cherry-pick, whatever I had on my old hard drive is here - this is about a quarter of the lab reports I've had to write. Don't pay attention to any dates in LaTeX documents since those were autogenerated on download. Picking a couple at random should give a feel for how I write. Research writing can be found at the end of the [research page](https://seth-so.github.io/portfolio/research/){:target="_blank"}.
