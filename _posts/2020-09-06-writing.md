## Introduction
I actually really enjoy writing - in an alternate timeline, I'm sure that I'm living the life as an essayist right now. Unfortunately I haven't quite gotten as many opportunities to write as an engineer. Still, I've always put forward a lot of effort into my technical writing and reports, so if you'd like a taste of that here are some samples in an ungodly mix of word and Latex:

# Circuit Lab reports

# Topical papers

# Presentations

# Publications
