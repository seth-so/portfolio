## Introduction
I really enjoy writing - in an alternate timeline, I'm sure that I'm living the life as an essayist right now. Unfortunately I haven't quite gotten as many opportunities to write as an engineer. Still, I've always taken pride in clear, concise writing even if its for technical reports now.

Likewise, I've always found the art of making and giving presentations enjoyable. Late night power point is oddly therapeutic, and when you give a presentation you get to command the room. The whole process is pretty gratifying, much more immediate than engineering projects. Here's a quick sample of some stuff I've done:

# Circuit Lab reports

# Topical papers

# Presentations

# Publications
