## Introduction
Research has been a pretty integral part of my work and design experience. I've been able to train on industry equipment at smaller scales, design a system from scratch and build it up for evaluation, and tackle my specific role in collaboration with others. Interestingly, it's really taught me the importance of storytelling - first to get funding for the project, and second to actually disseminate results in papers and at conferences

I got involved in research pretty early on - a stint assisting with animal surgeries in an immunology lab, and a taste of independent additive manufacturing research. After declaring for ECE, I began my current research: making and testing biosensors, TEP devices, and OLEDs.


# Nano-Biosensors
Designing, fabricating, and characterizing biosensors is my primary project. For better or for worse, the comparison I've found that helps people understand the best what I do is with [Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos){:target="_blank"}. The conceptual goal is to create a device that uses trace amounts of blood for rapid diagnosis - the major difference is that mine has evidence of working (and that I unfortunately did not receive +$700 million in funding).

# Micro-TEP Devices
This is a secondary project that I assist a colleague with. TEP stands for thermo-electric power, or simply converting heat gradients directly into electrical energy. Naturally, the aim is to create devices to place in areas with steep temperature changes to generate power. The project is currently in the optimization and formula tweaking phase.

# Organic LEDs
Fabrication of OLEDs has been an ongoing side query in collaboration with SAINT Lab from Sungkyunkwan University of South Korea.
