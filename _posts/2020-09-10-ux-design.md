## Introduction
One of the most valuable courses I took during undergrad was called Art of Making (AoM). It was IDEO fieldguide-inspired course that heavily emphasized to user-centered design. Design thinking is just like any other tool - there are times for it and times not for it. While it isn't always the correct paradigm for a problem, it did teach me the importance of staying engaged client-side throughout all steps of the design process.

From sticky note ideation to ethnographic observation, having this incremental workflow that constantly prompted reevaluation helped me build up creative confidence to picture something in my head and just start trying things. While not quite technically difficult, these projects help show the creative, non-STEM elements of engineering.
