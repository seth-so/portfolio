## Introduction
Welcome to the miscellanea section! This is where all of the things that are too small to showcase on their own go. There won't be any boring documentation, just what I put into them - fun energy and laughs.

Everything here is the product of a "that would be kind of cool to try" moment plus a couple hours of work. There's a talking teddy bear and oscilloscope CRT among others. I had a blast working on them and imagine their only use being a small chance to make an internet stranger try to suppress a smile!
