## Introduction
Welcome to the miscellanea section! This is where things that are too small to showcase on their own go. There won't be any boring documentation, just a quick blurb to give context about what makes it cool.

Everything here is the product of a "that would be kind of cool to try" moment plus a couple hours of work. I had a blast making these and hope you enjoy, too. There's plenty more to come in the future!

# Paddington
{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveID-paddington %} <br />

This fellow's name is Paddington. Although he's lost his blue coat and red hat, Paddy has picked up 23 global accents - and become a spirit medium! Jokes aside, Paddington's heart runs off a RaspberryPi ZeroW and a battery pack in a recycled anti-static bag. The script loop constantly queries designated GroupMe channels looking for new messages to read out with the help of MACS, so anyone with a phone can use play with him, no set up required.

I promise its not just an audiofile layered on top - I had to furiously type all the messages and commands each take, hence the long pauses! I actually plan to learn video editing and script-writing by making a series of skits with Paddy as the protagonist. However if you're interested in the code end of things, see [Coding (link here)] for more details!

# Batter-Up
This was a totally technology agnostic project in early school days (sophomore year?), before I knew how to make anything. The goal was to create a system to improve baseball bat-swing angle that was light weight and portable, specs predetermined. The end result was a modular stand assembly with a weight-shedded MDPE folding board.

The project actually had a "client" (non-paying 3rd party), and it was my first experience with building something for someone else. It went terribly. The deliverable was 2 months late, what was delivered failed on every spec. save that it stood upright, and the other 3 team members had pretty much quit on me half-way through. Still, I'm adamant it was a valuable learning experience. I learned how to keep dying project on life support, the importance of transparency, and

# Infinity Box
I'd always wanted to make an infinity cube for a long time, and I just recently got a chance to do it.

# ACCelerate Smithsonian Exhibition - Our Time is Up
*Our Time Is Up* was a civic engagement art exhibition at the Smithsonian (American History, Lemelson Center) for the inaugural ACCelerate Festival. The premise was a fictional audio drama made entirely from spliced bits of 2 unrelated autobiographical interviews from the [Legacy Project](https://www.legacyproject.org/){:target="_blank"}

I had the wonderful opportunity of designing and working on the physical component of the project. I designed and wired the electronics for the final display - an open-air room, sparsely furnished, where the drama was supposedly taking place. The challenge was to integrate and wire 4 hidden 2-channel audio sources into the scene, and it took hollowing out everything and a lot of gaffer's tape top accomplish! Unforunately I don't have any pictures of my own, but here's the [exhibition page](http://acceleratefestival.com/acc_project/our-time-is-up/){:target="_blank"} to at least prove it exists.

# CRT Audio Oscilloscope
{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveID-oscilloscope %} <br />

To cap things off is a project near and dear to my heart - my first electrical engineering project. This was the very definition of an amateur experience - solo late night solo near-death experiences, devolving my only laptop into an uncontrollable tinnitus machine, and best of all completely blowing out a university class' iMac right before final presentations were due. There are so many stories tied to this that I'll never forget.

The way it works is pretty simple. All you need to do is cross and modify CRT i/o channels to create electronic synethesia (fancy speak for music visualizer). Switch x and y channels, replace video with audio to modulate the vertical deflection coil, toss in an amplifier, sprinkle in some balance-resistors, and voil√†, you have an oscilloscope. Pretty simple process for a stunning result!
