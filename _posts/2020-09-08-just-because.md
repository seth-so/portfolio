## Introduction
Welcome to the miscellanea section! This is where all of the things that are too small to showcase on their own go. There won't be any boring documentation, just what I put into them - fun energy and laughs.

Everything here is the product of a "that would be kind of cool to try" moment plus a couple hours of work. I had a blast making these and hope you enjoy, too. There's plenty more to come in the future!

## Paddington

This fellow's name is Paddington. Although he's lost his blue coat and red hat, Paddy has picked up 18 new global accents - and become a spirit medium! Jokes aside, Paddington's heart runs off a RaspberryPi ZeroW and a battery pack in a recycled anti-static bag. The script loop constantly queries designated GroupMe channels looking for new messages. Once a good one is found, we ping Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (MACS) with message content, format, and specific user data before reading back a good old Text-to-Speech message. See [Coding (link here)] for more details!

## Batter-Up
This was a totally technology agnostic project in early school days.

## Infinity Box
I'd always wanted to make an infinity cube for a long time, and I just recently got a chance to do it.

## Blender

## Sketches

## CRT Audio Oscilloscope
