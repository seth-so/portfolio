## Introduction
It's hard to avoid programming in our world, but if you do, you should really reconsider. I didn't anticipate it, but nearly everything I have worked on has required me to learn coding. That said I'm a mostly self taught. Whenever a task called for coding, I learned whatever was needed from the ground up. Case in point this portfolio - I had zero web-dev experience coming in but buckled up to learn enough css and nodejs to cobble together you're seeing now.

I'm proficient in Python and specialize in MATLAB, but I've found myself capable of picking up new languages on the spot as needed. My next goal is to learn Julia, which is similar to Python but as fast as C. Code can be hard to incorporate into a portfolio, so here are some of the more visual outputs I've created:
