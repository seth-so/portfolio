## Introduction
It's hard to avoid programming in our world, but if you do, you should really reconsider. I'm a design engineer first and foremost, but nearly everything I have worked on has required me to learn coding. That said I'm a mostly self taught programmer. Whenever a task called for coding, I learned whatever was needed from the ground up. Case in point this portfolio - I had zero web-dev experience coming in but buckled up to learn enough css and js to cobble what you're seeing now.

I know a bit of everything, but I'm most proficient in Python and specialize in MATLAB. The first I've picked up as my mainstream language, and the second has been needed for all academic work. Here are the outputs of some code I've written!
